# Background #

This page outlines the opportunities for collaboration with other developers of FlywheelMS.


# Collaboration Technology #

It is important that all developers install standard collaboration tools to facilitate quick/easy/frictionless/spontaneous collaboration.

All tools must be cross-platform:
  * windoze
  * linux
  * Mac

Our current standards include:
  * Skype
  * TightVNC
  * RealVNC

## Skype ##

Google `"Skype download [YourOperatingSystem]"` with your operating system.  Nothing special here.

We do not use the Skype screen sharing feature; only voice for conference calls.

## TightVNC ##

Google `"TightVNC download [YourOperatingSystem]"` with your operating system.

### Windows ###
If on Windows, install both viewer (client) and server components.  You will often be using the viewer to access the computer of the person hosting the collaboration.

### Linux ###

Do not use TightVNC on Linux.  Use RealVNC.

## RealVNC ##

Google `"RealVNC download [YourOperatingSystem]"` with your operating system.

### Windows ###
If on Windows, just install the viewer (client) component as an alternative to TightVNC.

### Linux ###

Install both viewer (client) and server components.  You will often be using the viewer to access the computer of the person hosting the collaboration.

### Server setup ###

You will need the server component when you are the host of a collaboration.

It would be most helpful if you register your computer with DynDns.com so that everyone can just use a host name to get to your computer.  Check with Steve Stamps if you would like him to register you as a standard/regular FlywheelMS[x](x.md) collaboration host.

Be sure to configure a password for your server and share it with the participants via Skype while hosting a session.

For security purposes it is recommended that you:
  * go into Windows/Services and configure the service for manual startup
  * only start/run your server during the actual collaboration session
  * stop your server immediately after the collaboration session
  * change your server password frequently

# Schedule #

There is currently only one standard collaboration session, which occurs Monday through Thursday evenings from 8pm - 9:30pm central time.

Additional sessions are expected to emerge as new programmers join the effort and teams form around specific areas of the code base or management science.

## Weeknight collaboration session ##

  * Monday through Thursday
  * 7:30pm - 8:30pm
  * Topic: all things Flywheel Management Science and FlywheelMS
  * Skype initiated by facilitator (usually Steve)
  * a VNC server hosted by whoever is making the presentation
```
    HostName (when Steve is hosting) = Flywheel1.DynDns.org
    Steve will publish the password for a session (when changed) over Skype
```

Currently Steve Stamps is the host of those sessions.  Send Steve (steve.stamps) your Skype handle and he will call you/everyone when the session begins.  These session can sometimes start late; when Princess Thryn demands extra papa attention to get her _stuff/homework/music_ done before bed time.  ;-)
