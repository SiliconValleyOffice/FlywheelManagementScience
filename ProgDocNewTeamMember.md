# Overview #

Flywheel Management Science(tm) is a unified management approach to providing agile leadership to high performance work teams.  The software tool for efficiently implementing and perpetuating this management approach is called FlywheelMS(tm) Workbench.

Since Google announced they are not going to continue their development of the Eclipse plugin, we migrated from Eclipse to Android studio in August 2014.
