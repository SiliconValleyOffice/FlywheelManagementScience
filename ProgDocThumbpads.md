gConGUI is primarily a user interface for sophisticated tablet applications.  The screen orientation of the tablet is usually locked in the horizontal position.  The tablet is held with two hands, much like a dedicated video game controller.

gConGUI includes a left and right thumpad for controlling the application.  Thumbpads are a vertical strip along the left and right edges of the tablet.

Thumpads include one or more of the following:
  * menu (spinnnable or not)
  * FDK keypad
  * multi-shift button
