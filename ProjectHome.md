Flywheel Management Science is an agile leadership tool for managing the "Xbox Generation" of scientists and engineers who are reinventing our world.

Rather than the traditional management approach of trying to "herd cats", this Android tablet application implements the gConGUI game console GUI and the DecKanGL (Decorated Kanban Glyph Language) visual management language to fully engage this generation of builders.  The leadership, planning, and management of their efforts seems more like an engaging video game, making it fun to become a much more effective team.

We are currently in the "science project" phase, finalizing the initial frameworks (550+ Java classes and interfaces) and database design (70+ tables).  We will begin building a team of developers around this open source application in January of 2015.

Deployment to the Google Play Store is anticipated in May of 2015.
