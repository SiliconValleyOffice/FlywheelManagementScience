# Introduction #

All data in the FMM Repository is shared via PDF files.  This ensures that:
- the data is not modified, and always represents the actual Repository data at a point in time
- the data is always presented in a standard format, which enables anyone who has worked on a Flywheel Team to quickly/easily digest information published by another Flywheel Team (also makes it much easier for executive management)
