#summary GUI User Documentation - Keyboard Short Cuts.

# Overview #

These are the keyboard short cuts that will accelerate information capture in FlywheelMS.  Physical keyboards in Android act differently than virtual keyboards, so we have documented these separately.

Although FlywheelMS is designed for a wide audience of people who want to review or edit a Flywheel Story, it is designed primarily to optimize the rapid capture and organization of structured information by a professional facilitator to define and manage the work of High Performance Work Teams (Flywheel Teams).

Please let us know (FlywheelMS@gmail.com) if there are any other keyboard short cuts or usability improvements that would increase the speed or accuracy of capturing and organizing structured information for Flywheel Teams.

# Keyboards #

It is highly recommended that FlywheelMS be used with a physical keyboard when creating stories, facilitating a meeting, or any activity that generates a significant volume of information/changes.  Although most of the input will be via the FDK (Flywheel Dictation Keyboard), it is easiest to make minor edit or co-facilitate a meeting with a full bluetooth keyboard.

There are many outstanding blue tooth keyboards specifically for Android.  FlywheelMS has been tested with one of our favourites; Logitech 920-003390 Tablet Keyboard for Android 3.0 Plus.

Since physical keyboards in Android can still exhibit different behaviours (or not) for the same key sequence, please notify us of:
  * any keyboards that do not work as expected
  * any keyboards not listed below that work well with FlywheelMS (we will expand the list as you let us know)

We sincerely hope that this inconsistency between physical keyboards will be eliminated as the Android platform matures on the tablet and laptop platforms.
