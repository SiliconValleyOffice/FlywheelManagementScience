# FlywheelManagementScience
Fractal management model utilising DecKanGL data visualization and Flywheel Widget Framework for user input and interaction

This was a proof-of-concept application built for a much older version of Android, SDK version 17.

Coding style was consistent with an archaic standard still being used in a commercial Java application being supported
by the primary developer at the initiation of this project.

Primary objectives of this POC was to demonstrate the:
* Flywheel Management Model concepts
* DecKanGL data visualization language
* Flywheel Widget Framework
* Flywheel Dictation Keyboard
* GconGUI (Game console GUI)
