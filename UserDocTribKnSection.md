# Introduction #

The TribKn document section includes:
  * headline
  * DecKanGL glyph
  * governance
  * repository

This information becomes "richer" once the FSE document (Story) has been "attached" to a node in a shared Flywheel Management Model. (FMM) repository.

# Headline #

The headline is the "one liner" that describes the associated node in the the team's Flywheel Management Model.  It is the description you would give when someone important is passing you in the hallway (late for an important meeting) and asks; "What on you working on?"

# DecKanGL Glyph #

DecKanGL is a visual language for quickly communicating the TribKn (tribal knowledge) surrounding the associated node in the team's Flywheel Management Model (FMM).

The DecKanGL glyph provides more/richer information when the story is attached to a node in an FMM, but still provides useful information when the story is still just emerging in someone's shared DropBox directory.

# Governance #

Governance information includes who is the:
  * Sponsor
  * Customer (frequently)
  * Facilitator
  * Administrator (when appropriate for big FMM nodes like a Project)

This information is richer and more authoritative when the document/story is attached to a node in the team's Flywheel Management Model (FMM).

# Repository #

The repository describes how the collaborators are sharing the FSE document (Story).

There are 2 general approaches to sharing/collaborating around an FMS Story:
  * create/share an FSE document as a stand-alone story that is created/stored in a shared DropBox directory.
  * create/share an FSE document as an attribute of a Flywheel Management Model (FMM) node.  The document "lives" in an FMM Repository and is tightly linked to a specific FMM node in the model.
