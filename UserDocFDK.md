# Introduction #

The Flywheel Dictation Keyboard (tm) is a trademarked user input feature created for the Flywheel Management Science (tm) family of Android tablet applications.

The purpose of the FDK is to enable high-velocity data capture via voice input; in a manner that is convenient, accurate and includes appropriate punctuation.

# Achieving Both High Velocity and High Accuracy #

## Hardware Suggestions ##

Using a quality telephony headset is very important; dramatically increasing both speed and accuracy.  Reasons include:
  * built-in microphones are usually not high quality
  * built-in microphones are not positioned near your mouth
  * build-in microphones pick up ambient noise that garbles your spoken words

Headset can be either Bluetooth or hard wired.

An inexpensive ($12) hard-wired Logitech headset does an outstanding job.  Your tablet must support wired headsets (some only support headphones, but no microphone).  Make sure your headset has the appropriate adapter/connector for your tablet.

Bluetooth is an option if your tablet's operating system includes a Handsfree Bluetooth profile.  Make sure the headset has good microphone quality and minimal latency (when you begin to speak).

## Technique ##

You can expect to achieve outstanding results within a day or two of regular use:
  * Google will "learn" and improve
  * you will learn how/when to speak in a clear manner for recognition
